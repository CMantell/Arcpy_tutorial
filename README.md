## About The Project

This project is from an Esri web course introducing the use arcpy for writing scripts for geoprocessing in ArcMap.  The goal of this project was to get myself acquainted with using Python with ArcMap.  This was done with the goal of finding areas with invasive plants where chemical treatments can be used based on proximity to water sources and roads in San Juan National Forest in Colorado.

#### Importance of the Project

Invasive plant species are huge problems in protected areas such as national parks.  These plants tend to out-compete the local flora and can disrupt ecosystems.  If left untreated, invasive plants can lead to biodiversity loss, increased risks of devastating fires or landslides, and increased costs incurred by taxpayers as we foot the bill for the removal of these plants.  While chemical treatment of these plants can be quick, cheap, and safe, care must be taken when targeting areas for chemical treatment.  Plants that grow near water sources or roads where people traverse are not the best places for chemical treatments of invasive plants.

### Project Overview

> 1. BufferRoads.py, BufferWater.py, UnionTreatmentAreas.py are Python scripts written to make buffer polygons around roads, water sources, and both respectively.  The code was written by myself through Esri's web course.

> 2. 'Treating Invasive Plants in San Juan National Forest Map.png' is a screenshot of a map made in Layout Mode with ArcMap with the features through the above arcpy scripts.
